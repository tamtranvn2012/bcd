MU Plugins Tool allows you to activate or deactivate any MU (must-use) plugins that are installed - on an individual basis or all at once.

== Description ==

When you activate MU Plugins Tool, a folder named 'mu-plugins' is created, if necessary, in your WordPress installation (default 'WordPress_Root/wp-content/mu-plugins') and a starter mu-plugin is created. The starter mu-plugin changes the admin footer text once you've enabled it through MU Plugins Tool. For more information, see the Codex [Must-Use Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mu-plugins-tool` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Changelog ==

== Future Features - no promises ;-) ==

* create, edit & delete MU-plugins with MU Plugins Tool;
* upload MU-plugins from your computer;
* view a MU-plugin's code by hovering over the name;

* recreate the starter plugin at will

== Acknowledgement ==
I would like to thank [David Gwyer](http://www.presscoders.com), the developer of [Plugin Options Starter Kit](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/plugin-options-starter-kit) (POSK). It's an awesome tool for learning the ins and outs of designing an options page for your plugin. MU Plugins Tool would've been much harder to make without POSK as a learning tool.
